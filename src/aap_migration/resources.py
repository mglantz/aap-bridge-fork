"""Central resource type definitions - single source of truth.

This module provides the definitive registry of all supported resource types
in the AAP migration tool. All other modules should import from here rather
than defining their own hardcoded lists.

This ensures consistency across:
- CLI commands (export, import, migrate, cleanup)
- Migration phases
- Exporter/Importer factories
- API endpoint mappings

DYNAMIC DISCOVERY (NEW):
If `schemas/source_endpoints.json` exists (created by `aap-bridge prep`),
functions will use discovered endpoints dynamically. Otherwise, falls back
to the hardcoded RESOURCE_REGISTRY below.
