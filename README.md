# AAP Bridge

A production-grade Python tool for migrating Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)
installations from one version to another, designed to handle large-scale
migrations (e.g., 80,000+ hosts)

## Supported Versions

**Source AAP:**
- AAP 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 (RPM-based or containerized)

**Target AAP:**
- AAP 2.5, 2.6 (containerized recommended)

**Common Migration Path:**
- AAP 2.4 (RPM-based) → AAP 2.6 (containerized) ✅ Tested

The tool automatically detects AAP versions and validates compatibility before migration.

## Features

- **Bulk Operations**: Leverages AAP bulk APIs for high-performance migrations
- **State Management**: SQLite or PostgreSQL-backed state tracking with checkpoint/resume capability
- **Idempotency**: Safely resume interrupted migrations without creating duplicates
- **Dynamic Inventories**: Full support for migrating dynamic inventories including:
  - Inventory containers
  - Inventory sources (SCM configuration)
  - Inventory source schedules
  - All hosts from dynamic inventories
- **Professional Progress Display**: Rich-based live progress display with
  real-time metrics (rate, success/fail counts, timing)
- **Flexible Output Modes**: Normal, quiet, CI/CD, and detailed modes for
  different environments
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with separate console (WARNING)
  and file (DEBUG) levels
- **Split-File Export/Import**: Automatic file splitting for large datasets with
  metadata tracking
- **CLI Interface**: Intuitive Click-based CLI with extensive options and
  environment variable support
- **RBAC Migration**: Separate script for migrating role-based access control assignments

## Architecture

The tool is organized into several key components:

- **Client Layer**: HTTP clients for source AAP, target AAP, and HashiCorp Vault
  with retry logic and rate limiting
- **Migration Layer**: ETL pipeline with exporters, transformers, and importers
  for all AAP resource types
- **State Management**: Database-backed progress tracking, checkpoint creation,
  and ID mapping
- **CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface for all operations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12** or higher
- **Hardware**: Minimum 8GB RAM recommended for large migrations
- **Network**: Access to Source AAP and Target AAP
- **Credentials**: Admin access to both Source and Target AAP instances
- **Database**: SQLite (built-in, no setup) or PostgreSQL (optional, for 100k+ resources)
- **HashiCorp Vault** (Optional but recommended): For migrating encrypted
  credentials securely

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/antonysallas/aap-bridge.git
cd aap-bridge

# Create virtual environment
uv venv --seed --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

2. **Install dependencies and editable package:**
This command will create/update your virtual environment, install all dependencies (including development dependencies), and install the `aap-bridge` package in editable mode.

uv sync
```

### Configuration

The project includes configuration files with recommended default values. You need to set up your environment variables for AAP credentials and the database.

#### 1. Database Setup

The tool uses a database to track migration state (ID mappings, checkpoints, progress). **SQLite is the default** - no setup required!

**Database Comparison:**

| Feature | SQLite (Default) | PostgreSQL (Optional) |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Setup** | ✅ Zero configuration | Requires PostgreSQL server |
| **Capacity** | Up to 80,000+ hosts | 100,000+ resources |
| **Location** | Local file | Local or remote |
| **Backup** | Copy single file | Database dump |
| **Best For** | 95% of migrations | Enterprise scale |

##### Option A: SQLite (Default - Zero Configuration) ⭐ Recommended

SQLite is a file-based database that requires no server setup. Perfect for most migrations.

- ✅ **No installation required** - Built into Python
- ✅ **Automatic setup** - Database file created on first run
- ✅ **Handles large migrations** - Tested with 80,000+ hosts
- ✅ **Easy backup** - Just copy the `migration_state.db` file
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Successfully used in AAP 2.4 → 2.6 migrations

**No configuration needed!** The default `.env` uses SQLite.

##### Option B: PostgreSQL (Optional - For Enterprise Scale)

Consider PostgreSQL only if you need:
- Migrations with 100,000+ resources
- Distributed/remote state access
- Cloud RDS integration

**Important:** This is a separate PostgreSQL instance for migration state tracking, NOT AAP's internal database.

```bash
# Create PostgreSQL database and user
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE aap_migration;"
psql -c "CREATE USER aap_migration_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';"
psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE aap_migration TO aap_migration_user;"
# Ensure the user owns the schema/tables (Postgres 15+)
psql -d aap_migration -c "GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO aap_migration_user;"
```

Then update `.env`:
```bash
MIGRATION_STATE_DB_PATH=postgresql://aap_migration_user:password@localhost:5432/aap_migration
```

#### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure your credentials:

```bash

cp .env.example .env

```

Edit `.env` with your AAP instance details and database connection string.

**Critical AAP 2.6 Note:** The Target URL must point to the **Platform Gateway** (`/api/controller/v2`), not the direct controller API.

```bash

# Source AAP instance
SOURCE__URL=https://source-aap.example.com/api/v2
SOURCE__TOKEN=your_source_token

# Target AAP instance (Platform Gateway)
TARGET__URL=https://target-aap.example.com/api/controller/v2
TARGET__TOKEN=your_target_token

# State database (SQLite by default - no setup required!)
MIGRATION_STATE_DB_PATH=sqlite:///./migration_state.db

# For PostgreSQL (enterprise scale only):
# MIGRATION_STATE_DB_PATH=postgresql://aap_migration_user:password@localhost:5432/aap_migration

# HashiCorp Vault (Optional)
# If configured, the tool can inject credentials. If skipped, credentials must
be manually recreated.
VAULT__URL=https://vault.example.com
VAULT__ROLE_ID=xxxxx
VAULT__SECRET_ID=xxxxx

```

#### 3. Application Configuration

Review and adjust `config/config.yaml` for your environment:

- **Performance settings**: Adjust batch sizes and concurrency based on your AAP instance capacity
- **Logging**: Configure log levels and file paths
- **Migration phases**: Enable/disable specific resource types

1. Update `config/mappings.yaml` if you need to rename resources during migration (e.g., credential types with different names between AAP versions).

### Usage

#### Basic Commands

```bash

# Menu Based CLI
aap-bridge

# Migrate full AAP
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml

# Export from source AAP only
aap-bridge export all --output exports/

# Import to target AAP only
aap-bridge import inventories --input exports/inventories.json

# Validate migration
aap-bridge validate all --sample-size 4000

# View migration report
aap-bridge report summary

# Migrate RBAC role assignments (separate script)
python rbac_migration.py

```

**Note:** RBAC role assignments are migrated using a separate Python script (`rbac_migration.py`) after the main migration completes. This ensures all resources exist before assigning roles. See [USER-GUIDE.md](USER-GUIDE.md) for detailed RBAC migration instructions.

#### Output Control

The tool provides flexible output modes for different environments:

```bash

# Default: Live progress display with clean console output
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml

# Quiet mode: Errors only (for scripting)
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml --quiet

# Disable progress: For CI/CD environments
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml --disable-progress

# Detailed stats: Show additional metrics
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml --show-stats

# Combination: Quiet + no progress for automation
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml --quiet --disable-progress

```

**Output Modes:**

- **Normal** (default): Live progress display with real-time metrics, WARNING-level console logs
- **Quiet** (`--quiet`): Minimal output, errors only
- **CI/CD** (`--disable-progress`): No live display, structured logs suitable for CI pipelines
- **Detailed** (`--show-stats`): Additional statistics and timing information

**Environment Variables:**

```bash

# Configure via environment
export AAP_BRIDGE__LOGGING__CONSOLE_LEVEL=WARNING
export AAP_BRIDGE__LOGGING__DISABLE_PROGRESS=true
aap-bridge migrate full --config config/config.yaml

```

#### Split-File Export/Import

For large datasets, the tool automatically splits exports into multiple files:

```bash

# Export with custom split size (default: 1000 records/file)
aap-bridge export --output exports/ --records-per-file 500

# Import handles multiple files automatically
aap-bridge import --input exports/

```

**Export Structure:**

```text

exports/
├── metadata.json           # Export metadata
├── organizations/
│   └── organizations_0001.json
├── inventories/
│   ├── inventories_0001.json  # 1000 records
│   ├── inventories_0002.json  # 1000 records
│   └── inventories_0003.json  # Remaining records
└── hosts/
    ├── hosts_0001.json
    └── hosts_0002.json

```

## Performance Targets (TBD)

- **Migration Rate**:
- **API Request Rate**:
- **Memory Usage**:
- **Total Time**:

## Key Design Principles

### Bulk Operations

The tool uses AAP's bulk operations API to dramatically improve performance:

- Hosts: 200 per request (API maximum)
- Inventories: 100 per batch
- Credentials: 50 per batch

### Checkpoint Recovery

All migrations are checkpoint-based, allowing safe resumption:

```bash

# Resume from last checkpoint
aap-bridge migrate resume

# Resume from specific checkpoint
aap-bridge migrate resume --checkpoint inventories_batch_50

```

### Idempotency

The tool tracks all migrated resources in a state database, ensuring that running the migration multiple times is safe and won't create duplicates.

## Migration Order

The tool migrates resources in the correct dependency order:

1. **Phase 1**: Organizations, Labels, Users, Teams
2. **Phase 2**: Credential Types, Credentials
3. **Phase 3**: Projects (with sync), Execution Environments
4. **Phase 4**: Inventories (bulk operations, including dynamic inventories)
5. **Phase 5**: Inventory Sources (SCM configuration for dynamic inventories)
6. **Phase 6**: Hosts (bulk operations, 200/batch - AAP maximum)
7. **Phase 7**: Schedules (including inventory source schedules)
8. **Phase 8**: Job Templates, Workflows
9. **Phase 9**: RBAC role assignments (via separate `rbac_migration.py` script)

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Critical Limitations

1. **Encrypted Credentials**: AAP API returns `$encrypted$` for secret fields. Credentials must be:
   - Recreated in HashiCorp Vault before migration (if using Vault), OR
   - Manually recreated in target AAP after migration

2. **Duplicate Hostnames**: AAP 2.6 enforces stricter hostname uniqueness validation. If source AAP has duplicate hostnames within the same inventory, those hosts will fail to migrate. Solution: Rename duplicates in source before migration.

3. **API Timeouts**: Large operations may timeout with default settings. If you encounter timeouts:
   - Increase timeout values in `.env` (e.g., `SOURCE__TIMEOUT=300`, `TARGET__TIMEOUT=300`)
   - Reduce concurrency in `config/config.yaml` (e.g., `max_concurrent: 5`, `rate_limit: 10`)

4. **Platform Gateway (AAP 2.6+)**: Target URL must use Platform Gateway path `/api/controller/v2` (not `/api/v2`)

5. **Manual RBAC Migration**: Role-based access control assignments are migrated via separate `rbac_migration.py` script (not included in main migration workflow)

### Dynamic Inventories

Dynamic inventories are fully supported with the following configuration in `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
export:
  skip_dynamic_hosts: false
  skip_smart_inventories: false
  skip_hosts_with_inventory_sources: false
```

**What Gets Migrated:**
- ✅ Inventory containers (dynamic and static)
- ✅ Inventory sources (SCM configuration)
- ✅ Inventory source schedules
- ✅ All hosts (including hosts from dynamic inventories)

**Post-Migration:** You can manually trigger inventory source syncs or wait for scheduled syncs to update hosts from external sources.

### Success Stories

The tool has been successfully tested with:
- ✅ **AAP 2.4 → AAP 2.6** migrations
- ✅ **80,000+ hosts** in production environments
- ✅ **10+ inventories** including dynamic inventories
- ✅ **23+ credentials** across multiple credential types
- ✅ **15+ job templates** with dependencies
- ✅ **Complete RBAC** role assignments (72-94% automated)
